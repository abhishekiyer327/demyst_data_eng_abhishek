# demyst_data_eng_abhishek
This repo has the files which are a part of my submission to the demyst data engineering test

Few points to note-
1. I have attempted problem 2 - Created a csv with some random data
2. I have also included the output files (csv) generated by the code
3. For the distributed computing part, I have added the code in the same .py file, but it did not run in my personal laptop because of some issued with Pyspark installation. So I have demonstrated that the code works in a Pyspark environment that I use for my practice. Only change in the code is that there I am using dataframe and displaying and here I am reading and writing the file. I have uploaded an html showing the output there that the code works!
